# DnD_4e_Roll_Calculator
The first project I am working on.  This program will be used to calculate attack rolls (as of right now) and eventually other types of rolls.

Look at the Java files for some information I do not include here.

I currently have finished the skeleton of this program, text fields getting input, radio buttons with groups, basic checks, etc.
I will eventually need to include databases to make the process smoother when getting information than right now (lists in classes to check information.

I am looking to learn new techniques and improve my current skills by working on this project.  Please pull any suggestions you think will be able to help me improve.

My first edit has fixed a few things with have a function handle mulitple jobs at once and also the implementation of an abstarct class to build off of for the character's information.

Future edits I am focusing on how to improve the system for getting the weapons roll process simpler.
