# DnD_4e_Roll_Calculator
The first project I am working on.  This program will be used to calculate attack rolls (as of right now) and eventually other types of rolls.

Look at the Java files for some information I do not include here.

I currently have finished the skeleton of this program, text fields getting input, radio buttons with groups, basic checks, etc.
I will eventually need to include databases to make the process smoother when getting information than right now (lists in classes to check information.

I am looking to learn new techniques and improve my current skills by working on this project.  Please pull any suggestions you think will be able to help me improve.
